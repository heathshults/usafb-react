# Getting Started

## Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

## Start Development Server

```bash
yarn start
```

## Run Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Linter

For this project, we are using eslint that will automatically display errors on your text-editor/IDE. If you are
having trouble installing eslint, follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)

# Architecture

## build

compiled files

## assets

includes images, fonts

## css
based on ITCSS architecture. For reference https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/
Settings – font, colors definitions.
Tools – globally used mixins and functions.
Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition.
Elements – styling for bare HTML elements.
Objects – class-based selectors which define undecorated design patterns.
Components – specific UI components.
Utilities – utilities and helper classes to override any style (using !important)

# Components

## Classification

All components can be found/grouped in one of 2 categories:

### Components

All **Components** are those that have no side effects (read: they are not connected to the redux store, all data comes
in via props and nothing global is accessed or produced).

They are found in `src/components/`.

### Pages

All **Pages** are those *Containers* that are directly mounted into a `<Route>` handler. They are stored in a
directory/name structure that mimics the urls they are mounted to.

# Redux Modules

## Summary

Our Redux modules are based heavily on [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) but vary slightly. Modules
will follow a certain set of rules:

1. Modules will only contain code directly related to Redux
2. Modules may only import constants from other modules in their reducer
3. Modules may only import action creators from other modules in their sagas
4. Modules may not import reducers and sagas from other modules

## Naming Scheme

### Folders

lisp-case

### React Components

PascalCase

### Other Files

camelCase

## Structure

All modules may contain any combination of the following files:

### actions.js - Constants

All module related constants will export each constant individually. Ideally no other module imports constants directly.

### reducer.js - Reducer

The reducer.js file export defaults a function named `reducer`. This reducer will be directly injected into the
`combineReducers`.

Individual methods may be exported individually for testing only.

### sagas.js - Sagas

The sagas.js file export defaults an array of saga functions to be concatenated directly together into the
`createSagaMiddleware` method.

Saga methods may be exported individually for testing only.

### selectors.js - Selectors

The selectors file will export individual functions to select relevant pieces of the module store for use in pages and
connected components. No page or connected component should be reading from a store directly, but should
instead use selectors to read what it needs from the store.

## Utility Methods

All utility methods should be placed in the toplevel utils folder and not inside a module. If it is not wholly and
completely utilized for Redux it does not belong in the module.

An example of a "wholly and completely utilized" method would be like a formatting method for a reducer. This method
should be in the reducer.js file.

An example of a "utility" method that is NOT wholly tied to Redux would be a date formatting function. This method
should simply be placed in a common date-time.js file in the toplevel utils folder, even if it is currently only being
used by a single module.


## Testing

For this project, we will be using Jest to make sure each component renders and behaves correctly. It comes preinstealled with create-react-app,
so you shouldn't have to do anything to configure jest. If you are getting the error "Error: Error watching file for changes: EMFILE", make sure you
do a "brew install watchman".

Tests should lie in their respected components folder, inside a directory named "tests". For the sake of consistency and clarity, we will name each 
test as {component}.test.js. 

Our tests are using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html#content), [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/blob/master/docs/guides/jest.md), and [redux-saga-testing](https://github.com/antoinejaussoin/redux-saga-testing)
